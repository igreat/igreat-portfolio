**I'm an explorer in computer science and mathematics**, often challening myself in those fields. I also try to bring the skills that I learn throughout my journey to good use, and I try to build practical projects!

**I'm an International Takatuf Scholar** of the year 2020, which means that I am on a 6 year journey of studying abroad, 4 of which will be at university.

I'm currently finishing high school at **St Michaels University School** in Victoria BC and I'll be graduating in 2023.
